## Language Basics

### Comments
Flow language supports inline comments to aid in script documentation, a comment
starts with `--` and finishes at the end of the line:

Example:
```
-- This is a comment
flow onboarding do
  say 'Hi' -- This is a comment too
done
```


### Identifiers

Identifiers are a sequence of alphanumeric symbols and the underscore (`_`).
They must start with alphabetical or underscore symbol.

Example

**Valid identifiers**
```
_name
```
```
name
```
```
this_is_an_identifier24
```

**Invalid identifiers**
```
1invalid
```
```
Hi!_
```

### Reserved Words

```

define   do      done   empty
end      entity  equal  flow

### Script Sections

#### Integration install

![integration install grammar][install-grammar]

Example
```
install outlook using "outlook-configuration.json"
```

> **NOTE** Although the grammar is defined, no code is generated... yet.

#### Carousel Definition

![Carousel definition grammar][carousel-grammar]

A carousel definition represents the relationship between a set of object member names
with the slots of a carousel card set to the card content slots of a carousel

The valid slots in a carousel card are:

- _title_ (mandatory)
- _description_ (optional)
- _image\_url_ (optional)
- _buttons_ (optional, two or three buttons)

Dynamic Carousel Example
```
carousel contacts_carousel:
  set title contact_name,
  set description contact_phone,
  set image_url contact_avatar
end
```
Static Carousel Example
```
carousel options_carousel:
  card:
    set title 'Option 1',
    set description 'contact_phone',
    set image_url 'http://example-bucket.com/images/contact_avatar.jpg'
    button postback('Label', action:'action-text', id:'option-id'),
    button postback('Object', action:'action-object', args:$args),
    button url('My Web Site', 'http://example.com')
end
```
Dynamic Carousel Example (with buttons)
```
carousel contacts_carousel:
  set title contact_name,
  set description contact_phone,
  set image_url contact_avatar
  button postback('Label', 'postback message'),
  button message('Say Hi', 'Hi')
end
```

#### Menu Definition

![Menu definition][menu-grammar]

Menus are lists of buttons indentified by a name. Once they're defined you can
use them later.

```
menu mainOptions 'Please pick an option':
  button message('Option One'),
  button postback('Option Two', 'clicked the second button'),
  button url('External Option', 'http://example.com/document.txt')
end
```

You can also define empty menus and populate them with buttons comming from a
variable. This is useful if you get the button list at runtime through an
integration call

```
menu dynamicMenu '{{$dynamicMessageVariable}}'
```

> If you define an empty menu, you must specify a variable holding the buttons
> when display the menu: `show dynamicMenju using $buttonList`.
>
> This variable has to honor the shema for button lists

#### Intent and Entity Definition
![Intent and Entity definition][intent-entity-def]

Examples
```
define intent greeting "Hello", "Hi"
```
```
define entity person using "person-entity-def-file.json"
```

For details see [intents and entities][intents] documentation.

#### Command Definition

![commands grammar][commands-grammar]

The commands feature helps you to bypass the NLP and jump to any flow you want.

Examples
```
when read "/hi" do say_hi_flow

flow say_hi_flow do
  say "Hello World"
done
```

#### Flow Definition

A list of one or more dialogs see [flow](#flow) section for details.

### Expressions

Syntactically, an expression can be either a **string**, **number**,
**constant**, **variable**, **entity**, **intent** or a **binary operation**:

#### Strings

Text strings are arbitrary sequences of characters bounded by single or double
quotes.

Examples
```
"This is a valid string"
```
```
'This is a valid string too'
```

#### Numbers

Right now there is support for integer numbers only

#### Constants

- **empty**
- **null**
- **nil**



#### Objects

The identifiers are used to express more complex symbols like:

- **variables**: `$identifier`
- **entities**: `@identifier`
- **intents**: `#identifier`

Any of these symbols can have members:

- `$integration.method.member`
- `@entity.instance`
- `#intent.value`

#### Binary Operation
Let EXP be a **string**, **number**, **constant**, **variable**, **entity**, **intent**, then:

![Binary operation][expression-grammar]
![Operator][operator-grammar]

## Statements
### Actions
![action grammar][action-grammar]

#### Bot Says
!['say' action grammar][say-grammar]

Examples
```
say "Hello, I am a simple bot"
```
```
say 'Hello, I am a 'sample' bot, '
    'nice to meet you'
```


#### Bot Asks
!['ask' action grammar][ask-grammar] <!-- TODO: update the grammar chart -->

Examples
```
ask "What can I do you for?" as variable
```
```
ask "What can I do you for?" as variable keeping context
```
```
ask "Do you want to continue?" as variable with:
    reply "Yes",
    reply "No"
```
```
ask "Would your like to recive offers? as variable with:
  reply "Sure!" as @yes,
  reply "Maybe later, thanks!" as @no
  fallback "I will ask you later"
```
```
ask "Would your like to recive offers? as variable with:
  reply @yes,
  reply @no
  fallback "I will ask you later"
```


#### Bot Waits
!['wait' action grammar][wait-grammar]

This action reads a value from the user without prompting any question.
The wait action expects a list of entities, so quick replies' grammar is being
reused. In addition, the compiler does not allow setting text to the expected
entities.

Plus, it supports supports disabling context switching using the `keeping
context` keywords

Examples
```
wait variable
```
```
wait variable keeping context
```
```
wait variable with:
  reply @yes,
  reply @no
  fallback "I didn't understand you, did you mean yes or no?"
```

#### Set Variable

!['set variable' action grammar][var-grammar]

You can store values in custom variables. This operation supports basic
arithmetic and storing objects

**Examples**

Specify a literal scalar value
```
var botNmae = 'Robotina'
```
```
var millenniumStartedOn = 2000
```

Store the value of an arithmetic operation
```
var year = 1955
var backToTheFuture = $year + 30
```

Store an object as a sequence of _key: value_ pairs
```
var persona = name: 'Max Power',
              age: 36
```

Store an array as a comma separated list of things
```
array colors = 'Red', 'Orange', 'Yellow', 'Green', 'Blue', 'Indigo', 'Violet'
```

Store an empty value
```
var nothing = empty
```
```
var none = nil
```

#### Change Flow
!['change flow' action grammar][change-grammar]

```
change flow menu
```


#### Open Flow
!['open flow' action grammar][open-grammar]

```
open flow menuFlow
```


#### Call Function
![Call function grammar][call-function-grammar]

Example
```
call outlook.get_collaborator_by_name(name, tag)
```
```
var params = page: 2,
             per_page : 100
var request_arguments = params: $params
call rest.post('github', '/user/repos', $request_arguments) as repos
```

#### Show Components

![Show component grammar][show-component-grammar]
```
SHOW_COMPONENT: 'show' IDENTIFIER ['using' EXPRESSION]? ;
```

The supported components are carousels and menus. The `using EXPRESION` syntax
is valid for carousels only.

Examples
```
show contacts_carousel using $outlook.get_collaborators and pick name
```
```
show onboarding_options -- This is a menu
```

#### Open Flow

![Open flow grammar][open-flow-grammar]

Example
```
open flow followup
```
#### Subscriptions

Users of Facebook bots can subscribe to broadcast feeds to receive periodic
messages from the bot, by declaring an action **subscribe**. The user can also
be unsubscribed from feeds with **unsubscribe** action. These actions must
specify an existent feed name.

Examples
```
subscribe 'feed name'
```
```
unsubscribe 'feed name'
```
### Blocks
![Block grammar][block-grammar]

Example:
```
do
  say "hi"
done
```

### Control statements
![Control statements][control-grammar]

Examples:
```
if $identity equal "The Boss":
  say "Hey, you're the boss!"
```

```
if $variable is empty
  ask "You did not specify a value" as variable
  say "Thank you!"
end
```

```
if $variable is empty:
  ask "You did not specify a value" as variable
else:
  say "The variable is {{$variable}}"
```

```
if $variable is empty
  say 'You did not enter the variable'
  ask 'Please enter a value' as variable
else:
  say "The variable is {{$variable}}"
```

```
if $variable is empty
  say 'You did not enter the variable'
  ask 'Please enter a value' as variable
else:
  say "The variable is {{$variable}}"
  say 'Thank you!'
end
```

### Flow
![Flow Grammar][flow-grammar]

Examples:
```
flow say_hi do
  say "Hello"
  ask "What's your name" as user_name
  say "Nice to meet you {{$user_name}}"
done
```
```
flow say_hi given #greeting do
  ask "What can I help you with?" as user_response
  if $user_response equal 'show menu' change dialog menu
done
```
```
fallback flow say_hi do
  say "Sorry, what did you mean?"
  say "These are the things I can help you with:"
  show stuff
done
```

### Including code

It is possible to split the conversation script in several files and include
them from a _root_ script using the `%include` directive.

```
%include module
```

When a like lake the one above is find by the compiler, it will look for a file
`module.flow` in the current work directory and replace the line by the file's
contents before the compilation process starts.
